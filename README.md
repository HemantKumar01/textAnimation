## Usage
1. save and load textAnimation.css (in head) and textAnimation.js (at end of body) in your html file
2. add class `text-wipe-in-parts` to parent element inside which words(to be animated) are present. It finds the words using regex so it does not matter whether parent element contains child elements or not.
